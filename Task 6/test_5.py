Control System Creation and Simulation
---------------------------------------

Now that we have our rules defined, we can simply create a control system
via:
"""

tipping_ctrl = ctrl.ControlSystem([rule1, rule2, rule3])



tipping = ctrl.ControlSystemSimulation(tipping_ctrl)


# Pass inputs to the ControlSystem using Antecedent labels with Pythonic API
# Note: if you like passing many inputs all at once, use .inputs(dict_of_data)
tipping.input['quality'] = 6.5
tipping.input['service'] = 9.8

# Crunch the numbers
tipping.compute()

"""
Once computed, we can view the result as well as visualize it.
"""
print(tipping.output['tip'])
tip.view(sim=tipping)

"""
.. image:: PLOT2RST.current_figure

The resulting suggested tip is **20.24%**.

Final thoughts
--------------

The power of fuzzy systems is allowing complicated, intuitive behavior based
on a sparse system of rules with minimal overhead. Note our membership
function universes were coarse, only defined at the integers, but
``fuzz.interp_membership`` allowed the effective resolution to increase on
demand. This system can respond to arbitrarily small changes in inputs,
and the processing burden is minimal.
